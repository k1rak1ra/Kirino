# Native Android all-in one anime app (VERY OLD PROJECT - NO LONGER MAINTAINED)

Back when this app was maintained, it could:
- Fetch anime and manga data from AniList, allow you to sign into your account, and edit watch progress/etc
- Add items to your watching/reading list
- Stream items on your watching list either via Crunchyroll (automatically finds right show, and automatically resumes from where you left off and updates your watching progress)
- Stream items from Masterani (the site has since shut down, so this no longer works. Also automatically found the right item)
- Read items from MangaRock, internal APIs probably changed since this app was in use and this also no longer works
- Add characters to a favourite character list
- Fetch images of favourite characters from Gelbooru based on tags
- Fancy automatic character name to gelbooru tag-matching feature


All the sites whos APIs I reverse engineered either shut down or changed how they worked, and I gave up on this project. I may rewrite it in Flutter and get back to it in the future.
