    <string name="CR_warning">Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netfilx, Amazon and other western so-called legal anime licensors/streaming services
        are killing anime and the anime fandom in the west through their anti-competitive practices, providing a grossly inferior service, and forceful insertion of their politics into their product/service.
    These companies are neither a charity, nor your friend. They do not care about Japanese creators, their work, or the fans at all (and in fact resent them). You are not supporting the industry in any way by subscribing
    to these services and paying money for them. You should strongly consider cancelling your subscription and using pirate streams. If you want video quality, download a torrent from a fansub site.
    If you want to support the industry, buy blurays and/or merchandise directly from Japan.</string>
